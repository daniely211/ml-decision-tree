# ML Decision Tree Coursework

## Evaluation

To run the evaluation code in the terminal type:

```
python3 evaluation.py [data]
```

where `[data]` is the path to the data to be evaluated, e.g.:

```
python3 evaluation.py wifi_db/noisy_dataset.txt
```

## Visualisation

To run the visualisation code in the terminal type:

```
python3 visualization.py [data]
```

where `[data]` is the path to the data to be evaluated, e.g.:

```
python3 visualization.py wifi_db/noisy_dataset.txt
```

This will plot a pruned and unpruned tree for the given data set.
